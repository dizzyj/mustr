# Why?
Like many others, after graduating with a CS degree I struggled to find work. Not only were tech positions scarce, local employers were afraid to hire me for retail and food positions. To them, hiring a CS grad that will just get hirded in a week or so at a large tech company making a gazzillion dollars isn't worth their investment. As a result I ended up doing construction and labor around town. 

While doing things like building decks, built-in closets, and laying flooring isn't such a bad gig, I found one issue is keeping track of hours worked. This proffession often requires individual employees to keep acountability for their own hours and report to their employer. In my case, I work as an hourly employee of the homeowners I build for and need to keep track of time spent on the job over irregular time periods. In my experience most others I know rely on memory or simple pen and paper.

Memorizing your hours has it's obvious issues, especially when you often work irregular hours over irregular periods. Pen and paper works, but has it's own downsides. Firstly, paper is fragile. While moving to and from jobsites while transporting various tools in a multitude of weather conditions, a simple piece of paper can easily get lost or damaged. Paper can also be difficult to keep organized. Sometimes I work multiple jobs congruently and need to track hours for different people, possibly at different rates. It isn't impossible to track this on paper, but it does take effort to stay organized and there is always the fragility of paper that set back all your efforts.

# What?
This app aims to be a simple way for a user to log their hours while working afield without encumbering them with features. A user will create jobs then clock in and out of them with notes. They will also be able to quickly view total hours worked as well as their net pay. The user will be able to export various reports, such as invoices, in PDF form. 

# What this is not
This is not a payroll app. An organization cannot monitor and administrate multiple emplyees using this app, though I do want to add this in the future.
